### How to Run
###
######################
#
#
#  There are two parameters: 
#  -H will print out latex document and pstricks headers.
#  -P will print out just pstricks headers.
#  -I will draw a symbol for the initial state.
#  -C will read in the counts instead of a path
#  -L will assume loopless when reading in counts
#  -A <num> will be arrowSep
#
#  Usage: drawstategraph 3 4 -H < (file with strings)
#     eg: drawstategraph 3 4 -P < <(echo 1231 1212) 
#     eg: drawstategraph 3 4 -C < <(echo 1 0 1 0 2 0 1 0 2)
#     eg: drawstategraph 3 4 -C -L < <(echo 0 1 0 2 1 0 )


#  to run, type the following command
	./drawstategraph S T < input.file  > output.file

#  where S and T are integer numbers and the input file
# contains an even amount of words of length T in S letters
# 
# The output is a TeX code that draws the State Graph
# and requires the package 'pstricks'
#
######################
#
# the option - P adds the \begin{pspicture} and \end{pspict}
#

	./drawstategraph 3 4 -P < testinput3.txt

##################
#
# The option -H creates a self contained LaTeX file
# starting with the \documentclass, \begin{document} and so
#

	./drawstategraph 3 4 -H < testinput3.txt

#################
#
# The option -I is for including the initial states in the graph
# by making a larger node on the initial state
#
	./drawstategraph 3 4 -I < testinput3.txt
